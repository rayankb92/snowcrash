we have a script in Perl:
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag04 level04 152 Mar  5  2016 level04.pl

the script take an argument from cgi in an http context and execute it with system
we can see in the comment that the script is available at localhost:4747
we can use the script to execute the getflag command

http://localhost:4747/level04.pl?x=%3Bgetflag
so the script will exec echo ;getflag with the necessary permissions
