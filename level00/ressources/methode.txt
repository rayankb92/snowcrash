Use find command to search for files that are owned by user flag00 or group00
Command:
-user specify user for a file
-group specify group for a file
-redirect error output to null and exclude /proc files
level00@SnowCrash:~$ find / -user flag00 -group flag00 2>/dev/null | grep -v proc
/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

inside these 2 files we have "cdiiddwpgswtgt"  it looks like a password but
it does not work so by testing multi uncrypting method on dcode.fr we find
a string that looks like a password: "nottoohardhere"
