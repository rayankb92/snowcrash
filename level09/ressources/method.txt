we have token file wich contain a bad token wich look encrypted
and level09 file wich is a binary file
by uncompiling the binary file we can see that it's a c 
program that takes a string as an argument and modify it

it take the string and for each character it add the 
index of the character in the string to the character

so we can think that the token has been encrypted with
this script and we can decrypt it by reversing the 
comportement of the script

i coded a c++ program that do it

by executing the program with the token as argument
we get the decrypted token: f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq

then we connect to flag09 and exec getflag
