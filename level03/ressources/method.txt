get the level03 file with scp
scp -P 4242 level03@localhost:/home/user/level03/level03 .

open with ghidra to reverse the binary

the code reversed is:
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void main(void)

{
  __gid_t __rgid;
  __uid_t __ruid;
  
  __rgid = getegid();
  __ruid = geteuid();
  setresgid(__rgid,__rgid,__rgid);
  setresuid(__ruid,__ruid,__ruid);
  system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me");
  return;
}

the script set uid and gid to the real uid and gid of the user that owns
the binary then it executes the echo command with the env command
the binary is vulnerable to a path hijacking attack, we can create
a script called echo in /tmp that will be executed by the binary

so we create a script in /tmp called echo that will execute the getflag
command
